	<h3>IPRO 397: Global Health Challenges</h3>
	<!-- description of project -->
	<p>The goal of IPRO at IIT is to allow students to recognize and apply the soft skills necessary to 
		to succeed when working on inter-disciplinary teams. For this IPRO, the project was to optimize the
		operations of Samaritan groups who work along the US-Mexico border in the Sonora Desert. These groups
		primary mission is to save the lives of migrants who are crossing into the USA via the desert. Due 
		to the harsh conditions, thousands of people die each year trying to cross this border. Thus there 
		is a need to try to save as much lives as possible. Samaritan groups help by giving water and snacks along 
		with minor medical attention and in extreme medically dire cases will call border patrol to help. An aspect 
		of their operations is that they leave supplies in the desert in hopes that the people who need it, will 
		have access to it. However due to being left in the open, these supplies temd to perish before 
		the intended can users get to them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		To solve this problem, the team designed an emergency response device. It had two main components. The first aspect 
		of this device was an emergency beacon which can be used to call for help if the person chooses to. The next aspect 
		was a box at the base of the beacon that would contain supply care packages. The intent behind the care packages
		is that the migrants would be able to help themselves when they need to. 
		To monitor supplies, a pressure plate would be used to transmit data to the Samaritans (the controllers of the beacons) 
		and alert them when restock is needed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My primary role in the group was to map the journey of the users (the migrants and the Samaratans). I was also in charge
		of researching immigration policy and laws in the USA and using this knowledge to guide the design of the device that was created.

	<h3>Design a fully functional Electromyography</h3>
	<!-- description of project -->
	<p>For this project, the objective was to design and build an operational EMG that was 
		to be used to acquire signals from the biceps and triceps to control a motor. 
		The design included three components. These were: 
			<ol>
				<li> An EMG circuit to measure the signals. </li>
				<li> Using Phython, program a Raspberry to connect and control the speed/direction of the motor. </li>
				<li> Integrate the circuit and the motor using a digital converter.</li>
			</ol>
